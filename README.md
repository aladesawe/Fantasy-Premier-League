# Fantasy-Premier-League

This repository contains codes used for player evaluation, point projections and team optimization in Fantasy Premier League. 

To update latest data and run projections, run
```
source venv23-24/bin/activate  
python src/fpl_analysis.py <latest_gameweek> 
```
at the repository root. In the above <latest_gameweek> refers to the most recent finished FPL gameweek (not the upcoming one). 

Note, however, that the projects in this repository are not meant to be run as-is, because the underlying data is not stored in the repository.
